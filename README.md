# AI-powered-instagram-bot

Overview
This repository showcases the code for an Instagram Engagement Bot that I developed. The bot features several algorithms designed to interact with Instagram users effectively. Please note that this repository is primarily for demonstration purposes and may require additional setup and customization for practical use.

Features
Random Hashtag Search: Developed an algorithm that randomly searches through an adjustable array of Instagram hashtags, enabling engagement with a diverse pool of new posts.

Automated Responses: Created a method that analyzes Instagram post descriptions and automatically generates responses using the ChatGPT API, allowing the bot to engage with users meaningfully.

User Interaction Suite: Implemented a suite of methods for autonomously liking, saving, and unfollowing users at randomized intervals, enhancing user engagement strategies.

Human-like Interaction: Designed humanizing methods to simulate realistic timing for actions performed by the Puppeteer API, minimizing detection as automated activity.

Disclaimer
This repository is intended to showcase my coding abilities and the functionality of the bot. Due to potential complexities and the need for further configuration, it may not be suitable for direct use without modifications. Users interested in implementing this bot should have experience with the relevant technologies and be prepared for additional setup.
